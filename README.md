### Simple Series

The Simple Series aims to maintain repos of the simplest way to build various frontends that interact with smart contracts. You can find more from this series at the end of this page.

### Simple Ethereum DApp

Here is the simplest frontend (dapp) that interacts with a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. You can find the contract here - [Etherscan](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x22d52a1cd58e6ec803ca9b942d70cd8db44f08aa). This dapp is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and uses the [Alchemy API](https://www.alchemy.com/) to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. You can find more info about the contract in its [repo](https://github.com/thegitparticle/simple-ethereum-contract). The contract and this dapp are made to work with the [Ethereum Goerli Testnet](https://goerli.net/) currently.

#### How it use?

You can checkout the live hosted demon at - https://simple-ethereum-dapp.vercel.app/.
